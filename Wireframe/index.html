      <h2>Introduction to readme file</h2>
      <p>
        A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly
        required to understand what the project is about.
        It is usually the first file a user or contributor sees when they open a project repository on platforms like
        GitHub.

      <h2>Introduction to Wireframe</h2>
      <p>
        Think of a wireframe as a blueprint for a website. Wireframes are basic visual representations of a screen's
        content and functionality.
        They provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality,
        and intended behaviors.

      <h2>Introduction to Git branch</h2>
      <p>
        A Git branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. It allows you to work on different versions of a
        project simultaneously.
        Branching is a powerful feature in Git that enables you to create isolated environments for your work.
